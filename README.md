# Traffic Control

This Python code is configured to be implemented on semaphores and Mutex  subtraction, frame to frame comparison to detect motion objects, and object discrimination based on image size.

The light changing control consists on a base time-controlled routine, that commands a periodic light change under low-to zero traffic conditions. The presence of a vehicle in any of the concurrent roads triggers a request for a light change.
